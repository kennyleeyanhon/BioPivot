## What is molecular biology?
Molecular biology, field of science concerned with studying the chemical structures and processes of biological phenomena that involve the basic units of life, molecules [1].
Basically, viewing the chemical processes involved in organisms in molecular level would be the subjective view of molecular biology. Among all, the genetic materials, or nucleic acids, namely deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), are the 2 most iconic target to be investigated. 
Together with the interactions between proteins and nucleic acids would form the complicated mechanisms in organisms, and most importantly, in our bodies.
